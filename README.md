## 3. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a simple and user-friendly
weather application that provides real-time weather information of any city.
The application fetches live data from a weather API and displays temperature,
humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

---

## 4. Problem Statement
People often need quick access to weather information before planning daily
activities. Manually checking weather data from different sources is time-consuming.
This project aims to solve this problem by providing a single platform where users
can easily check real-time weather details by entering a city name.

---

## 5. Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3  
- **Scripting Language:** JavaScript  
- **API:** OpenWeatherMap API  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Web Browser  

---

## 6. Features of the Project
- Search weather details by city name  
- Displays temperature in Celsius  
- Shows humidity and wind speed  
- Dynamic weather icons based on conditions  
- Error message for invalid city names  
- Responsive and clean user interface  

---

## 7. Working of the Project
1. User enters the city name in the input box.
2. On clicking the search button or pressing Enter, the application sends a request
   to the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. The API returns weather data in JSON format.
4. JavaScript processes the data and updates the UI dynamically.
5. If the city is not found, an error message is displayed.

## 8. API Used
- **API Name:** OpenWeatherMap API  
- **Purpose:** To fetch real-time weather data  
- **Website:** https://openweathermap.org/api  

> Note: The API key is used only for academic and demonstration purposes.

## 9. Output Screens
- Home Screen with search input  
- Weather details screen showing temperature, humidity, and wind speed  
- Error screen for invalid city name  

(Screenshots can be attached separately in the project report.)

## 10. Advantages of the Project
- Easy to use and understand  
- Real-time data fetching  
- No complex setup required  
- Improves understanding of API integration and JavaScript  

---

## 11. Limitations
- Requires an active internet connection  
- Shows only current weather data  
- Limited error handling  

---

## 12. Future Scope
- Add 5-day weather forecast  
- Detect user location automatically  
- Add temperature unit toggle (°C / °F)  
- Convert the project into a React-based application  

---

## 13. Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
build a real-world application. It helped in understanding API integration,
asynchronous JavaScript, and dynamic DOM manipulation. The project fulfills the
requirements of a BCA 5th Semester Minor Project.
